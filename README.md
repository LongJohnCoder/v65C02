        * [verilog-65C02](https://github.com/hoglet67/verilog-6502) soft core
        * 16-bit address bus
        * 8-bit data bus
* Memory
    * 32K x 8-bit RAM
        * 8x 36Kb Xilinx Block RAM
    * 16K x 8-bit ROM
        * 4x 36Kb Xilinx Block RAM
* Graphics
    * IBM VGA 80x25 16-color text
        * 720x400 at 70Hz
    * 4K x 8-bit Video RAM
        * 1x 36Kb Xilinx Block RAM
    * 4K x 8-bit Character ROM
        * 1x 36Kb Xilinx Block RAM
* PS/2 Keyboard
